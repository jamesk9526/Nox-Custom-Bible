Documentation: Formatting Bible Verses for Nox Custom Bible Plugin

The Nox Custom Bible plugin is designed to recognize and highlight Bible verse references within your content. To ensure accurate recognition and formatting, it's essential to follow a specific notation when writing out Bible verses. As of the current version, the plugin supports a basic notation, but with time, updates will be rolled out to accommodate more formatting options.
Current Supported Notation:

    Book Name followed by Chapter and Verse, separated by a colon (:).
    Book abbreviations should be standardized as per the abbreviations.json file included in the plugin.
    If mentioning multiple verses, use a hyphen (-) to indicate the range.

Examples:

    Single Verse:
        Correct: John 3:16
        Incorrect: Jn 3 16

    Verse Range:
        Correct: Romans 8:28-30
        Incorrect: Rom 8 28 to 30

    Multiple References:
        Separate different references with a semicolon (;).
        Example: Genesis 1:1; John 1:1; Revelation 22:21

Future Updates:

We are working tirelessly to improve the Nox Custom Bible plugin, and part of that involves enhancing the range of recognizable verse notations. In future versions, we aim to support:

    Space or other common separators between book name, chapter, and verse.
    Different book abbreviations.
    Multiple verse references without the need for a semicolon.
