## Description

Nox Custom Bible is a WordPress plugin designed to enable custom Bible verse popups on your website. With just a simple hover over the referenced scripture, your visitors can view the Bible verse without needing to navigate away from your page. This plugin enhances the user experience on your Christian blog or website by providing an interactive way to explore biblical references.

## Usage

Once activated, the plugin will automatically highlight Bible references in your posts and pages. When a user hovers over a reference, a popup will appear displaying the corresponding verse.

### Formatting Bible Verses

The Nox Custom Bible plugin is designed to recognize and highlight Bible verse references within your content. To ensure accurate recognition and formatting, it's essential to follow a specific notation when writing out Bible verses. As of the current version, the plugin supports a basic notation, but with time, updates will be rolled out to accommodate more formatting options.

**Current Supported Notation:**

- Book Name followed by Chapter and Verse, separated by a colon (:).
- Book abbreviations should be standardized as per the abbreviations.json file included in the plugin.
- If mentioning multiple verses, use a hyphen (-) to indicate the range.

**Examples:**

- Single Verse:
  - Correct: John 3:16
  - Incorrect: Jn 3 16

- Verse Range:
  - Correct: Romans 8:28-30
  - Incorrect: Rom 8 28 to 30

- Multiple References:
  - Separate different references with a semicolon (;).
  - Example: Genesis 1:1; John 1:1; Revelation 22:21
